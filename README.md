# Amazon_electronics_recommender
A content-based recommender of Amazon electronics based off product text reviews

Despite user-based collaborative recommender systems where a user rates certain items and items favored by the user are passed on to similar users popularity, they do possess certain disadvantages. The disadvantages include not having ratings for new products from many users, and also not having side features being included in the recommendation of the item. Basing recommendations off user reviews of the products solves these problems because we can use the lone review as a guidance to pair similar products. The second disadvantage is answered since the review often describes the side features that can be factored in to our similarity process. 

Content based memory systems require that a rich description of items must be given to the systems. Our product reviews serves this purpose.
